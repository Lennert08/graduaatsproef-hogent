\label{ch:summary}

This associate thesis describes the development and integration of a digital signature module within the cloud platform Recytix. Previously, an integrated solution for digitally signing documents, such as contracts and mandates, was missing. This resulted in inefficient processes and administrative burdens.

The initial goal was to create a prototype for signing documents via SMS verification. This goal was exceeded during the internship by also fully integrating **Itsme** authentication. The focus remained on usability, security, and scalability.

A modern technology stack was chosen: a frontend in \textbf{React} (TypeScript) and a backend in \textbf{C\# (.NET)}. Communication is handled via a RESTful API, and data is securely stored in a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database.

The core functionality includes viewing PDF documents and a choice flow between SMS or Itsme verification. Every step is accurately recorded in an audit trail. Additionally, comprehensive technical documentation was delivered in Confluence to facilitate future expansions (such as WhatsApp integration).

The result is a functional, secure module that seamlessly integrates with the Recytix platform. This significantly reduces the turnaround time of administrative processes and lays a solid foundation for further digitization.
